          Having been Head of the Property Team at 13 King's Bench Walk, 
          Robert has 40 years' experience in a wide range of civil litigation and
          advisory work, specialising predominantly in property and chancery
          matters, professional negligence and business law.
        </p>

        <p>
          His core areas of work cover:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>All aspects of real property, including conveyancing</li>
          <li>Landlord and tenant, both commercial and residential, including enfranchisement</li>
          <li>Commercial and other contracts</li>
          <li>Commercial disputes, including those affecting companies and partnerships</li>
          <li>Professional negligence, particularly involving solicitors, architects and surveyors where there is a real property connection</li>
          <li>General chancery work, including the obtaining of chancery remedies such as injunctions, rectification, rescission, accounts etc</li>
        </ul>


<p>Robert recognises that lay clients have become much more circumspect
about commencing litigation. There is good reason to fear now that 
litigation will become even more expensive and carry an increased risk 
that it will be determined not upon the merits but upon some 
technicality. Robert is often instructed to take up the challenge of 
seeing what would meet a client's particular needs and to indulge in 
lateral thinking, even outside his core areas identified above. Of 
course there are many cases where the client has no real alternative but
 to commence litigation but it may be possible to achieve what the 
client needs by writing the right letter or by other means.</p>

<p>Robert is just as happy when assisting with the putting together of a
 deal (such as a conveyancing contract) as he is when involved in 
litigation over a past problem.</p>
