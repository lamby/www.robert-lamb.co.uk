        <p>
          Robert has 40 years' experience in a wide range of civil litigation and
          advisory work, specialising predominantly in property and chancery
          matters, professional negligence and business law.
        </p>

        <p>
          His core areas of work cover:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>All aspects of real property, including conveyancing</li>
          <li>Landlord and tenant, both commercial and residential, including enfranchisement</li>
          <li>Commercial and other contracts</li>
          <li>Commercial disputes, including those affecting companies and partnerships</li>
          <li>Professional negligence, particularly involving solicitors, architects and surveyors where there is a real property connection</li>
          <li>General chancery work, including the obtaining of chancery remedies such as injunctions, rectification, rescission, accounts etc</li>
        </ul>
<p>
Robert recognises that lay clients have become much more circumspect
about commencing litigation. There is good reason to fear now that 
litigation will become even more expensive and carry an increased risk 
that it will be determined not upon the merits but upon some 
technicality. Robert is often instructed to take up the challenge of 
seeing what would meet a clientâ€™s particular needs and to indulge in 
lateral thinking, even outside his core areas identified above. Of 
course there are many cases where the client has no real alternative but
 to commence litigation but it may be possible to achieve what the 
client needs by writing the right letter or by other means.</p>
<p>Robert is just as happy when assisting with the putting together of a
 deal (such as a conveyancing contract) as he is when involved in 
litigation over a past problem.</p>

<p><strong>MAIN</strong><strong> CASES</strong></p>

<p><strong>Furlonger v Lalatta</strong> [2014] EWHC 37 â€“ judgment given 
January 2014 â€“ the court was persuaded to accept that the machinery 
contained in a rent review clause had broken down and new machinery 
should be substituted. Robertâ€™s opponent is seeking permission to 
appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Sopher v 3 Upper Belgrave Street Limited</strong> (2012) 
â€“&nbsp; with Katharine Holland QC - S claimed an extended lease against 
his landlord 3UBS. The LVT fixed its terms. However Sâ€™s solicitors 
failed to protect the notice of claim at the Land Registry and by the 
time of completion 3UBS was no longer the â€œlandlordâ€ under the 1993 
legislation. To reduce their exposure the indemnity insurers of Sâ€™s 
solicitors initiated this claim against the old and new â€œlandlordâ€. The 
trial before Mann J lasted 4 days before being settled.</p>
<p><strong>Hayward</strong><strong> v </strong><strong>Hayward</strong> 
(2010) â€“ with Richard Millett QC â€“ Sir Jack Haywardâ€™s children brought a
 claim in the Bahamas claiming Sir Jack had denied them their 
inheritance under certain trusts. Robert helped with the preparation of 
Sir Jackâ€™s evidence. The case was eventually settled.</p>
<p><strong>St George v </strong><strong>Hayward</strong> (2007-8) â€“ with
 Roger Ellis QC - The essential issues were the ownership of shares in 
the port companies at Freeport, Grand Bahama worth some $200 million and
 how the Bahamian Unfair Prejudice legislation (based on the Canadian 
model) should be construed. &nbsp;Roger and Robert represented the 
Chairman of the port companies and attended the Bahamas on 10 occasions 
to deal with the numerous applications. The client was eventually 
successful when Adderley J struck out the entire claim for lack of 
jurisdiction under the Bahamian legislation.<br>}<br>The Bahamian Court 
of Appeal hearing (2010) lasted 5 days before settlement was reached. 
Serle Court devotes a whole webpage to this case and there were 3 other 
separately represented parties.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity</strong><strong> Fund (Opportunity Bank of Brasil)</strong>
 (2005) â€“ with Roger Ellis QC â€“ successful application in Cayman Islands
 to set aside/discharge a $1 billion Mareva injunction. The case 
involved extremely complicated financial dealings.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Cash Flow v Southall</strong> [2004]EWCA Civ 817 CA â€“
 with Roger Ellis QC â€“ a case concerning the liability of one (S) of two
 guarantors with the unusual feature that S only discovered during the 
trial that the other one had never signed.</p>
<p><strong>OPM v Venner</strong> [2004] EWHC 427 (Ch) - a solicitor 
exchanged on a sale without his clientâ€™s (Vâ€™s) express authority. The 
judge was successfully persuaded that V had ratified the contract and 
specific performance was obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Faryab v Smyth</strong> (1996-7) with Roger Ellis QC â€“ F 
alleged that he and the client (S) were commercial partners and that he 
was therefore entitled to one-half of her fortune. The trial before 
Blackburne J lasted 81 court days and was reopened twice for further 
evidence. The judgment fills an entire lever arch file. It received 
limited publicity because of an order that the name of the head of state
 it referred to should not be disclosed. The preparations and trial took
 almost an entire year. The client was successful in resisting all of 
Fâ€™s claims.<br>}<br>Appeal to Court of Appeal [1999] ER(D) 286 â€“ client successful on appeal<br>}<br><strong>Faryab v Smyth no 2</strong> (2000-1) â€“ Neuberger J - client successful in resisting Fâ€™s attempts to reopen his claim.</p>
<p><strong>Smyth v Behbehani</strong> [1999] EWCA Civ 954 with Roger 
Ellis QC â€“ a case involving negative declarations and conflicts of law â€“
 client successful at first instance and on appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Habermann v Koehler</strong> (1997) 73 P&amp;CR 515 and 1999 - decisions of the Court of Appeal on aspects of proprietary estoppel.</p>
<p><strong>Suter v. Saunders et al</strong> (1992) â€“ Schiemann J - S had
 taken over company D and claimed that the Dâ€™s directors had misled it 
into paying too much by approving accounts that showed D in too good a 
light.&nbsp; S sued Dâ€™s directors and made claims of professional 
negligence against Dâ€™s financial advisers (Lazards) and Dâ€™s accountants.
 Robert represented the Dâ€™s Chairman. He and the other Defendants were 
successful 4 weeks into the trial when S abandoned its case and paid all
 the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Smith v Braintree District Council</strong> [1990] 2 AC 215 
House of Lords â€“ Robert presented the Respondentâ€™s case. On the face of 
it the case concerned rating and insolvency but the significance of the 
case lay in its relevance to poll tax defaulters who had become numerous
 by the time of the HL hearing - might they save themselves from going 
to prison by becoming bankrupt?</p>
<p><strong>JH Edwards v Central London Commercial Estates</strong> 
[1984] 271 EG 697 - a leading case in the situation where the court has 
to fix the term of a new business tenancy under 1954 Act and the 
landlord wants to redevelop at the end of the new tenancy.</p>
